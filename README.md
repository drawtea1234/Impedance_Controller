# Impedance_Controller
This repository implements an impedance controller for the Franka Emika robotic arm, integrated with the Onrobot HEX 6D Force/Torque sensor. It enables precise force regulation and compliant motion control, with adjustable stiffness and damping parameters. Includes documentation and experimental validation for force-controlled robotic applications.
